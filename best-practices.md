# Optimizing Vector Databases: Tricks and Best Practices

## Querying in Vector Databases
* Understanding the Querying Process

These are the steps that you need to follow to query a vector database:
1. Generating Embeddings: Convert your raw data, text or media, into vectors using ML algorithms or models.
2. Indexing: Upsert the vectors into the database and build to build your collection. All vectors of a collection must have the same dimensionality.
3. Querying: Convert your raw query, text or media, into a vector using the same ML model. Then pass it to the database along with any metadata filters you want to apply to limit the search space and get the results.

* Types of Queries: Similarity Search, k-NN, Range Search e.g. Grouped Documents, Metadata filtering
1. Similarity Search: It is performed by approximation algorithms like HNSW, NMSLIB, etc and is also called k-NN search.
2. Metadata Filtering: This is traditional search on the metadata that you ingest along with the embeddings. You can do all kinds of filtering on the metadata: range queries, exact match, full text search, etc dependending on what the database supports.
3. Recommendations: You can do a simple recommendation search based on this formula: `average_vector = avg(liked_vectors) + ( avg(liked_vectors) - avg(disliked_vectors) )` and then search for the average vector. Qdrant even provides an API for this out of the box.
